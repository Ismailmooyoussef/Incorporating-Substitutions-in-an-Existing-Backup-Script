# Incorporating-Substitutions-in-an-Existing-Backup-Script

You work for Universe Incorporated. One of your users — cloud_user — has an already existing backup script. Using Bash command substitution, modify the script to include timestamps in the log file both before any work is done and after all work is complete.

Once complete, ensure it runs and successfully backs up the required files.
